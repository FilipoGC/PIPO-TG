# PIPO-TG: Parameterizable High Performance Traffic Generation


## About PIPO-TG
PIPO-TG is positioned, focusing on the creation of a traffic generator specifically designed for the Tofino Switch. Powered by the P4 programmable data plane technology, the PIPO-TG offers the capability to customize and forward packets on the TNA architecture with line-rate packet generation, ensuring accurate performance evaluations without introducing bottlenecks or distortions. With the goal of to develop a traffic generator that can generate realistic and diverse traffic patterns. It incorporates the ability to emulate various network anomalies and behavior patterns. By simulating scenarios such as network congestion, link failures, packet drops, and other disruptive events, PIPO-TG enables researchers to assess the resilience and performance of network systems under realistic and challenging conditions.
